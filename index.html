    <h2>What is a Pangram Checker doing?</h2>
    <p>A pangram is a sentence or phrase that contains all the letters of the alphabet at least once. The term comes
        from the Greek words "pan," meaning "all," and "gram," meaning "letter." Some well-known examples of pangrams
        include "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs." Pangrams
        are often used in typography and graphic design to showcase all of the letters in a particular font. They can
        also be used as a fun and challenging word game.</p>
